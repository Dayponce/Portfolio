# About this research

The purpose of this thesis research is to explore the optimal light spectrum for coral recruits in land-based nurseries that promotes both survival and growth.
The study investigates the influence of different light spectra on the survival and growth of two tropical scleractinian coral species, Pseudodiploria strigosa 
and P. clivosa, aged between 5 to 14 weeks post-settlement. The data analysis involves using a Cox proportional hazard model for survival analysis and a
Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Model (GLMM) to compare coral growth under different light spectra over time, with the aim of identifying the most
beneficial light conditions for successful coral restoration efforts.
