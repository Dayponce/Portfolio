# About
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are extensively used in biology and natural science applications to model complex relationships between variables, especially when the relationships may not be linear. GAMs can capture non-linear and interactive effects, making them well-suited for ecological, environmental, and biological studies where intricate relationships between multiple factors need to be explored. They are valuable in analyzing ecological responses to environmental factors, understanding species distributions, and investigating the impact of various environmental stressors on ecosystems.

## 1. Phytoplankton Fluorescence and Depth Variation in Different Sample Locations

### Description:
In this analysis, a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) is applied to the ITIS2 dataset to investigate the effect of depth on phytoplankton fluorescence, considering different sample locations. The dataset includes variables such as depth (continuous) and station (categorical). Two GAM models are compared to determine the best fit, and statistical measures such as AIC, ANOVA, and smooth term significance are utilized to assess the model's performance. The results indicate that both predictors significantly affect fluorescence, with the relationship varying depending on the station. The models explain 97.9% of the variation in the response, demonstrating their effectiveness in understanding the data.

### Research Question:
Does the effect of depth on phytoplankton fluorescence vary between sample locations?
