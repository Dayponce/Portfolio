# About
Multiple Linear Regression is used in biological and natural science research to analyze and understand the relationships between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. It helps researchers identify and quantify the impact of different factors on the biological phenomenon under investigation, providing valuable insights into the underlying processes and influences.

## 1. Longnose Density
### Description:
In this study, Multiple Linear Regression was used to investigate how fish density (Longnose) is influenced by five continuous predictors: dissolved oxygen, depth, nitrates, sulfates, and temperature. The data was preprocessed with transformations and removal of less significant interactions. The results revealed that high levels of dissolved oxygen, greater depth, and higher nitrates were all positively correlated with fish density, whereas sulfates and temperature did not significantly explain variations in fish density.
### Research Question:
Does dissolved oxygen, depth, nitrates, sulfates, and temperature explain fish density?

### Data set:
Longnose.csv

#### Skills Used:
Multiple Linear Regression, data preprocessing with transformations, removal of less significant interactions, statistical inference, data visualization.
