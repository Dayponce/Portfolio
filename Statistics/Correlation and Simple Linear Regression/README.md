Correlation and Simple Linear Regression in Biology:
Correlation and simple linear regression are powerful statistical tools frequently used by biologists to explore relationships between variables and make predictions. These methods allow biologists to investigate connections between different biological parameters and uncover potential cause-and-effect relationships. Correlation helps to understand the strength and direction of association between variables, while simple linear regression enables the generation of predictive models based on one predictor variable. These techniques play a crucial role in hypothesis testing, understanding biological phenomena, and making evidence-based decisions in various biological research areas.

## Table of Contents
### 1. Hammerhead Shark Dataset Analysis:
#### Description:
In this exercise, the relationship between the maximum narial distance of hammerhead sharks and the height of their caudal fin is explored. The data analysis includes correlation testing, data transformations, and linear regression modeling. The results indicate a significant positive correlation between the two variables, and the linear regression model predicts the caudal fin height based on the narial distance.
#### Research Question:
Relationship between maximum narial distance and caudal fin height in hammerhead sharks.
#### Skills Used:
Correlation testing, data transformation, linear regression modeling, confidence interval estimation.

### 2. Coral Egg Dataset Analysis:
#### Description:
This exercise analyzes data related to coral species' egg sizes and their development times. The research question investigates whether egg size influences the development time of corals. The analysis involves data transformation, normality testing, ordinary least squares regression, and confidence interval estimation. The results show that egg size has a significant effect on the development time, and predictive models are generated for two specific coral species
#### Research Question: 
Effect of egg size on development time in coral species.
#### Skills Used:
Data transformation, normality testing, parametric and non-parametric testing, ordinary least squares regression, confidence interval estimation.
