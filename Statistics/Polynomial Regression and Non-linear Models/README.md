# About:
Polynomial Regression is a useful tool in biology research when the relationship between variables is not linear, as it allows for the examination of higher-order polynomial functions to better fit the data. Non-linear models are also crucial in biology research, as many biological processes do not follow linear patterns, and these models offer greater flexibility in capturing complex relationships between variables, providing valuable insights into various biological phenomena. Both Polynomial Regression and Non-linear Models play a critical role in understanding and interpreting non-linear relationships in biological datasets, enhancing the accuracy of predictions and improving our understanding of biological systems.

## 1. Stocking Density and Yield in Carps
### Description: 
The exercise explores the relationship between stocking density and Yield in carps. Initially, a simple linear regression is attempted, but the data doesn't meet the linearity assumption. After data transformation and trying different models, a polynomial regression of the 2nd order is chosen as the best fit. The result indicates that 69.77% of the variation in Yield can be explained by the stocking density.
#### Research Question: 
How does stocking density affect Yield in carps?
###Skills Used:
Simple Linear Regression, Data Transformation, Polynomial Regression, ANOVA

## 2. Impact of Oil Concentration on Coral Dead Area
### Description: This exercise investigates the relationship between oil concentration and dead area in corals. The data undergoes transformations, and different non-linear models are tested. The Four-parameter Logistic Model is selected as the best fit, indicating that the dead area significantly changes with oil concentration. Two predictions are performed, providing estimates of dead area at specific oil concentrations.
#### Research Question: Does oil concentration affect dead area in corals?
#### Skills Used: Simple Linear Regression, Data Transformation, Non-linear Regression (Four-parameter Logistic Model), Prediction

## 3. Relationship Between Fish Length and Age
### Description: The exercise explores the relationship between fish length and age. Data transformations are applied, and different non-linear models are tested. The Von Bertalanffy Growth Function is chosen as the best fit, showing that fish length significantly changes with age. Predictions are made to estimate fish length at specific ages.
#### Research Question: How does fish length change with age?
#### Skills Used: Simple Linear Regression, Data Transformation, Non-linear Regression (Von Bertalanffy Growth Function), Prediction

## 4. Fish Density Variation with Water Depth
### Description: This exercise investigates the relationship between fish density and water depth. Data transformations are applied, and different non-linear models are tested. The Simple Logistic Model is selected as the best fit, indicating that fish density significantly changes with water depth. A prediction is made to estimate fish density at a specific water depth of 800m.
#### Research Question: How does fish density (fish/Km2) change with water depth (m)?
#### Skills Used: Simple Linear Regression, Data Transformation, Non-linear Regression (Simple Logistic Model), Prediction
