# About
Descriptive statistics are widely used by biologists to summarize and analyze data related to various biological phenomena. Biologists employ these statistical measures to gain insights into the distribution, central tendency, variability, and other important characteristics of their data, helping them make informed interpretations and draw meaningful conclusions from their research.

## 1. Fish Dataset Analysis:
#### Description:
This exercise involves the analysis of a fish dataset, particularly focusing on the Standard Length (SL) of the fish. Various descriptive statistics such as mean, mode, median, range, variance, standard deviation, and quartiles are computed. Additionally, visualizations, including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, are created to explore the distribution and variability of the data.

#### Skills used:
Data analysis, statistical computations (mean, mode, median, range, variance, standard deviation, IQR, standard error, confidence interval), data visualization (histogram, box plot, scatter plot).


## 2. Cat Body Weight Analysis:
#### Description: 
In this exercise, the body weight (Bwt) data of cats is analyzed. Two visualizations are created: a histogram to depict the distribution of body weights with customized axis labels and colors, and a box plot to compare the body weights between different sexes while highlighting the mean. Descriptive statistics, including mean and other graphical elements like lines and labels, are used to summarize and interpret the data effectively.

#### Skills used: 
Data visualization (histogram, box plot), customization of plots (labeling axes, setting colors), adding lines to plots, and labeling points in the plot.
