# Analyzing Billboard Top 100 Songs (2013-2023) with SQL BigQuery

<sup>Over the last decade, the landscape of music has undergone a dynamic transformation, influenced not only by evolving tastes but also by the disruptive force of social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. These platforms have redefined how music gains popularity, with short-form videos becoming a dominant medium for discovery and virality. The integration of TikTok and Instagram Reels as major platforms for music promotion has reshaped the way artists and audiences engage with songs. A mere snippet of a song can become a cultural phenomenon overnight, impacting charts and influencing the overall music landscape. This shift in discovery methods is not only altering the way we find new music but also potentially affecting the characteristics of the songs themselves. As platforms increasingly compensate artists based on the first 30 seconds of a song, there's a notable incentive for musicians to capture attention quickly. This incentive could lead to a decrease in the overall length of songs, as artists strive to make an impactful impression within those critical initial seconds. The industry is witnessing a paradigm shift where brevity and instant engagement play a crucial role in a song's success.</sup>

<sup>In this project, we aim to delve into the Billboard Top 100 Songs from 2013 to 2023 using SQL BigQuery. Our focus will be on uncovering trends in the top genres over the years and exploring the average BPM (Beats Per Minute) and duration for each year. By analyzing these factors, we seek to understand the evolving musical landscape and its potential correlation with the changing dynamics of music consumption influenced by platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. The project's insights will not only provide a snapshot of musical preferences but also offer valuable perspectives on the impact of social media disruption on song characteristics. Let's explore the data and decipher the rhythmic pulse of the past decade's musical journey.</sup>
