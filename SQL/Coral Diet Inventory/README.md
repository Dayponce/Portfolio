# Coral Food Inventory Project
## About this Project
This project is centered around managing the orders for feeding adult coral colonies in land-based nurseries by the Marine Ecology and Recruitment Lab at NSU. 

By exploring and analyzing the collected data using SQL, the project facilitates informed purchase decisions, predicts the required ingredients for coral feeding, and enhances the efficiency of the ordering process for each item.
