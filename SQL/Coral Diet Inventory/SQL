Laboratory Orders Data Exploration 
Cleaned in Excel: To clean the Excel sheet and display only food order data from 2021 to 2023, 
a filter or data sorting tool was applied to extract and retain relevant rows corresponding to 
food-related orders within the specified date range. Non-food order entries from the original sheet,
spanning from 2016 to the present, were removed or filtered out, resulting in a clean datasheet 
containing only the desired food order information.

SQL Skills used: Data Aggregation function, Date Manipulation, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Grouping and Ordering Functions, Subqueries, Converting Data Types, Mathematical Operations, CASE Statements
